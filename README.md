# DiscJockey - an all-in-one custom Boombox solution

## About
DiscJockey has been created with one goal in mind - more control over your music. Why settle for random tracks when you can choose what you want to play?

Another goal was to be an all-in-one solution for Boomboxes - why download many mods when you can have just the one?

## Features
- A custom made vanilla style media player UI for boomboxes, opened with a configurable hotkey. Supports track scrubbing, play/stop, sequential/shuffle/repeat playlist algorithms, volume control and more!
- Custom track loading from disk - also searches for and loads other plugins custom tracks!
- Powered by yt-dlp and allows downloading audio in-game from any one of [these sites!](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/blob/master/supportedsites.md)
- **Fully Networked** - every interaction is synced over the network - scrubbed a track? other players will too. Downloaded a song? other players will too.
- Other miscellaneous QoL features, like being able to use the Boombox while in orbit.

## Planned
- Options for removing/configuring Boombox battery drain
- More configuration options, like restricting downloads to the host, enforcing a maximum download size, restricting downloads to certain sites, etc.
- Improvements to the UI, like a search bar.

## Adding Custom Music
Simply drag any **mp3**, **wav** or **ogg** file into the Custom Songs folder within the DiscJockey plugin folder.

## Bugs
DiscJockey has been tested extensively within my friend group, but that doesn't mean it's flawless. If you find any issues, please file an issue on GitHub [here](https://github.com/Yoshify/DiscJockey)
